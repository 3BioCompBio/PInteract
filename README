1. Modify the path to PInteract in the .zshrc, .cshrc or .bashrc file of the PInteract directory
   and add them to your own .zshrc, .cshrc or .bashrc file.
2. Compile PInteract: go to the PInteract directory and type “make”
3. Copy the PDB files (.pdb) to which you want to apply PInteract in a directory;
   if you want to have information about H-bonds, download and run hbplus
   and move the hbplus files to the same directory.
4. Type PInteract to run PInteract; you will be asked for the name of the directory containing the PDB files
5. The outputs are one text file and two csv files: PInteract.txt, PInteract.csv and PInteract1.csv
6. The default parameters are given in the file "parameters_default" in the PInteract directory. These are the
   maximum interresidue distance (in Angstrom) and and the factor multiplying the radius of the aromatic cycle
   which define the cylinder for the different pi-interactions: 
   - CATDmax and CATangmax1 for cation-pi, amini-pi and His-pi interactions
   - PiPiDmax and PiPiangmax1 for pi-pi interactions
   - SPiDmax and SPiangmax1 for sulfur-pi interactions
   The last parameter is the redundancy. If it is equal to 1, all pi-interactions are given in all the chains.
   If it is equal to 0, the pi-interactions that occur in identical chains are given only once.
   To modify the parameters, create and/or modify the file "parameters". The file "parameters_default" should not be
   modified.
